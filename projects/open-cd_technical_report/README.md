<!--## Open-CD Technical Report Plan -->

</div>

------

We are launching an interesting project - Open-CD Technical Report Plan (**Open-CD TRP** for short), aiming to create a comprehensive  technical report for Open-CD with the following features:

- **Continuously updated**

- **Multi-participant**

- **Open-access**

------

**Open-CD TRP** will include:

- **Supported Methods:**

  **Everyone** can submit a short description (200 words or less) of their proposed method to the **Open-CD TRP**, and we will update it to the [arXiv](), the contributor's name will be added to the author list, and the corresponding paper will be cited (the order of authors will be according to the contribution and the submission time). More importantly, we will assist authors in implementing their algorithms in Open-CD.

- **Architecture of Open-CD:**

  Open-CD's model representation, design philosophy, training process, scripts, etc.

- **Benchmarking Results**

  Some quantitative evaluations including F1-Score, IoU, Precision, Recall, FLOPs, inference time, etc. will be reported to facilitate comparison and analysis for subsequent studies.
